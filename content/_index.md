## Clean Air Conference

Let's connect clear air advocates! Together we can share strategies, tactics, ideas, what's worked well and what's not worked well so far, what we have yet to try. After sharing ideas and information, we can move on to taking concrete action from our computers while on call with each other and let people leave as they wrap up their online action points or attend to other obligations

## Event Details
